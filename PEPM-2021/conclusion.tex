\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We presented a fair semantics for \mk, which reduces the impact of conjunction order on the performance and convergence of relational specifications. Our approach
works particularly well for structurally-recursive relations, although this does not constitute a firm requirement.
The main direction for future work is implementing a complete mechanized proofs of all essential lemmas and theorems using \textsc{Coq}~\cite{fair:Coq} proof assistant.
Another important objective is extending the approach to handle non structurally-recursive relations.
