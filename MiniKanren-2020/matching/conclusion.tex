\section{Conclusion and future work}

We presented an approach for pattern matching implementation synthesis using relational programming. Currently, it demonstrates a good performance only
on a very small problems. The performance can be improved by searching for new ways to prune the search space and by speeding up the implementation of
relations and structural constraints. Also it could be interesting to integrate structural constraints more closely into \textsc{OCanren}'s core.
Discovering an optimal order of samples and reducing the complete set of samples is another direction for research.

The language of intermediate representation can be altered, too. It is interesting to add to an intermediate language so-called \emph{exit nodes}
described in~\cite{maranget2001}. The straightforward implementation of them might require nominal unification, but we are not aware of any
\textsc{miniKanren} implementation in which both disequality constraints and nominal unification~\cite{alphaKanren} coexist nicely.

At the moment we support only simple pattern matching without any extensions. It looks technically easy to extend our approach with
non-linear and disjunctive patterns. It will, however, increase the search space and might require more optimizations.
