\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We presented here the \textsc{Java} generics type solver implemented using relational verifier-to-solver
conversion technique. Our work showcases all major steps, properties, and caveats of the approach we advocate.
The solver demonstrates a promising performance and we consider integrating it into a production-level
symbolic execution engine as a main task of our future work.
