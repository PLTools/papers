Second, we present operational semantics which models interleaving, the distinctive feature of miniKanren implementation, and prove its soundness and completeness w.r.t. the denotational semantics. Our development is supported by a Coq specification, from which a reference interpreter can be extracted. We also derive from our main result a certified semantics (and a reference interpreter) for SLD resolution with cut and prove its soundness.",

Inspired by logic programming, our library provides, in addition to the operations required by the MonadPlus interface, constructs for fair disjunctions, fair conjunctions, conditionals, pruning, and an expressive top-level interface. Implementing these additional constructs is easy in models of backtracking based on streams, but not known to be possible in continuation-based models. We show that all these additional constructs can be generically and monadically realized using a single primitive msplit. We present two implementations of the library: one using success and failure continuations; and the other using control operators for manipulating delimited continuations.},

abstract="We present a completely declarative approach to synthesizing pattern matching construct implementations based on application of relational programming, a specific form of constraint logic programming. Our approach is based on relational representations of both the high-level semantics of pattern matching and the semantics of an intermediate-level implementation language. This choice makes our approach, in principle, very scalable as we only need to modify the high-level semantics in order to synthesize the implementation of a pattern matching new feature. Our evaluation on a set of small samples, partially taken from existing literature shows, that our framework is capable of synthesizing optimal implementations quickly. Our in-depth stress evaluation on a number of artificial benchmarks, however, has shown the need for future improvements.",

abstract = { An approach for systematically modifying the semantics of programming languages by semantics modifiers is described. Semantics modifiers are a class of programs that allow the development of general and reusable "semantics components". Language independence is achieved through the interpretive approach: an interpreter serves as a mediator between the new language and the language for which the non-standard semantics was implemented. Inverse computation, equivalence transformation and neighborhood analysis are shown to be semantics modifiers. Experiments with these modifiers show the computational feasibility of this approach. Seven modifier projections are given which allow the efficient implementation of non-standard interpreters and non-standard compilers by program specialization or other powerful program transformation methods. }

This is a major limitation, as such systems of constraints arise often in natural declarative specifications. We describe Cassowary---an incremental algorithm based on the dual simplex method, which can solve such systems of constraints efficiently. We have implemented the algorithm as part of a constraint-solving toolkit. We discuss the implementation of the toolkit, its application programming interface, and its performance.},

Given an application design consisting of a set of views and their location on the screen, we synthesize a relational layout that when rendered, places the components at that same location. We present an end-to-end system, called InferUI, that addresses the above challenge in the context of Android. The system is based on the following technical contributions: (i) a formalization of the latest and most efficient ConstraintLayout class, capturing a rich set of relational constraints, (ii) a set of robustness properties designed to prevent common layout generalization errors, (iii) a synthesis algorithm that produces relational layouts that generalize across multiple screen sizes and resolutions, and (iv) a probabilistic model of constraints that guides the synthesizer towards layouts preferred by developers. Our evaluation shows that InferUI is practically effective: it successfully synthesizes real world complex layouts obtained from top 500 GitHub and top 500 Google Play Store applications, succeeds in 100\% of the cases when synthesizing layouts for a single device, and correctly generalizes 92\% of the views across multiple devices, all without requiring additional specifications.},

abstract = {Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) have gained primacy among the means of interacting with computing systems, thanks to the way they leverage human perceptual and motor capabilities. However, the design of GUIs has mostly been a manual activity. To design a GUI, the designer must select its visual, spatial, textual, and interaction properties such that the combination strikes a balance among the relevant human factors. While emerging computational-design techniques have addressed some problems related to grid layouts, no general approach has been proposed that can also produce good and complete results covering color-related decisions and other nonlinear design objectives. Evolutionary algorithms are promising and demonstrate good handling of similar problems in other conditions, genetic operators, depending on how they are designed. But even these approaches struggle with elements' overlap and hence produce too many infeasible candidate solutions. This paper presents a new approach based on grid-based genetic operators demonstrated in a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-III) setting. The operators use grid lines for element positions in a novel manner to satisfy overlap-related constraints and intrinsically improve the alignment of elements. This approach can be used for crossovers and mutations. Its core benefit is that all the solutions generated satisfy the no-overlap requirement and represent well-formed layouts. The new operators permit using genetic algorithms for increasingly realistic task instances, responding to more design objectives than could be considered before. Specifically, we address grid quality, alignment, selection time, clutter minimization, saliency control, color harmony, and grouping of elements.},

abstract = {A key objective in the design of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) is to ensure consistency across screens of the same product. However, designing a compliant layout is time-consuming and can distract designers from creative thinking. This paper studies layout recommendation methods that fulfill such consistency requirements using machine learning. Given a desired element type and size, the methods suggest element placements following real-world GUI design processes. Consistency requirements are given implicitly through previous layouts from which patterns are to be learned, comparable to existing screens of a software product. We adopt two recently proposed methods for this task, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) and a Transformer model, and compare them with a custom approach based on sequence alignment and nearest neighbor search (kNN). The methods were tested on handcrafted datasets with explicit layout patterns, as well as large-scale public datasets of diverse mobile design layouts. Our results show that our instance-based learning algorithm outperforms both neural network approaches. Ultimately, this work contributes to establishing smarter design tools for professional designers with explainable algorithms that increase their efficacy.},

abstract={Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are widely used in human--computer interaction, providing a convenient interface for operation. Automating the conversion of GUI design images into source code can significantly reduce the coding workload for front-end developers. Detecting elements in GUI images is a key challenge in achieving automatic GUI code generation and is crucial for tasks such as GUI automation and testing. However, current state-of-the-art methods do not fully consider the unique characteristics of GUI images and elements, and they lack the required high localization accuracy, resulting in low detection accuracy for GUI element boxes. In this paper, we propose GUICG, an automatic GUI code generator that combines deep neural networks with image processing techniques to efficiently detect GUI elements from GUI images and generate front-end code. We empirically investigate various deep learning approaches and image processing methods for GUI component detection. Based on a comprehensive understanding of their performance and characteristics, we design GUICG by fusing image processing with a deep learning-based target detection model, achieving state-of-the-art performance. GUICG outperforms existing methods in accuracy and F1 score for component detection tasks, while producing human-readable code with a logical structure. Furthermore, we conduct an ablation study to quantitatively assess the impact of each key element in GUICG.},
