%% The abstract is a short summary of the work to be presented in the
%% article.
\begin{abstract}
  We present a new, \emph{fair}, conjunction evaluation strategy for relational programming language \mk. Unlike the original left-biased
  conjunction, our approach controls the order of conjunct execution based on the intrinsic properties of relation definitions.
  We present both the formal study of conjunction fairness and practical evaluation, which demonstrates the essential
  improvement in terms of both performance and convergence.

\begin{comment}
  
  Reviewer 1:
  
  2. The case studies that the evaluation section is based on seem somewhat small and toyish. Please say something about how representative they are.
  
  4. S3: You describe => as a "big-step" arrow, but it looks small-step to me?

  Fig. 2: Please clarify whether this small-step semantics is from [20] or somewhere else?

  I would have liked to have seen more summary information in the table in Figure 9 to show to ratio in timings between the three different semantics.

  Does the “naive semantics” correspond to a form of iterative deepening?
