\section{Conclusion}

In this paper we presented an extended version of formal semantics for \textsc{miniKanren} which supports disequality constraints.
The semantics is parametrized by an exact implementation of constraint stores and allows us to ensure the correctness of different implementations
in a unified way, using the given set of sufficient conditions.
