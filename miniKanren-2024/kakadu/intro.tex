\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}


One of distinguishable features of \miniKanren{} is the fact that it is a family of languages:
many languages may host different \miniKanren{} implementations.
For example, faster-\miniKanren{} for \Scheme{} and \Racket{}, \CoreLogic{} for \textsc{Closure}, \OCanren{} for \OCaml{}, \Klogic{} for \Kotlin{} and others.
The users of these DSLs may want to compare expressive power of various flavor of miniKanren, specifics due to host language, and performance implications of choosing a different host language.


The straightforward solution is to rewrite a number of significant benchmarks for many implementation, as it done for other languages\footnote{\url{https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/index.html}}.
Doing it manually is time consuming and error prone.
Due to low-level nature of relational programs, it is easy to make spelling mistakes, for example accidentally write wrong identifier in unification arguments.
(We did many of mistakes of this kind while porting programs from \OCanren{} to \Klogic{}.) Moreover, \miniKanren{} doesn't pardon relational programs that do the same thing: it was reported, that the order of conjuncts significantly affects performance even if the search does the same unifications~\cite{scheduling2022}.
