We approach a task of automatized design of  graphic user interface (GUI) by construction a system based and constraint programming.
It takes designer-specified layout constraints (\emph{guidelines}) and  logical structure of desired interface, and generate layouts,
each of which complies with these guidelines by construction.
The system is implemented as WEB application, and generates results in a real time.
%To
%We describe a system which, given a set of designer-specified layout constraints (\emph{guidelines})
%and a description of graphic user interface (GUI) logical structure generates a set of concrete layouts,
%each of which complies with these guidelines by construction. We give a formal treatment of the task as a
%constraint satisfiability problem and describe the construction of a sound and complete solver
%based on the utilization of \emph{relational verifier-to-solver} approach. We also describe a number
%of refinements which make the solver more efficient and applicable.
