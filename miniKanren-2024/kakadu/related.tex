%GUI design and implementation has been a hot topic for decades. Thus, to no surprise there is a lot of frameworks, approaches, papers
%and reports on the subject. A fair share of them (if not all) present declarative and automatic solutions. A careful study, however,
%discovers that this ``declarativeness'' and ``automation'' is understood differently then in our case.
%
%First of all, we need to mention some software frameworks and tools for design and implementation of GUI and visualization of data, for example, \textsc{React}~\cite{react},
%\textsc{Jetpack Compose}~\cite{Jetpack}, \textsc{SwiftUI}~\cite{SwiftUI}, \textsc{Streamlit}~\cite{Streamlit}, \textsc{D3}~\cite{D3} and others.
%These frameworks provide a number of layout primitives which end-users can employ in order to render their data or UI. For example, \textsc{Streamlit}
%provides a number of builtin layout primitives like ``columns'', ``container'', ``modal dialog'', etc.~\cite{StreamlitLayout} and an endless
%variety of third-party external components. These primitives allow end-users to abstract away of concrete controls coordinate calculation and their
%relative alignment; they also prescribe a reasonable behavior on enclosing pane resizing. However, which layout primitives to use is decided by
%end-users, not the system. If due to any reason the layout needs to be changed these changes have to be implemented manually. In our case
%end-users do not specify concrete layouts, only the logical structure of the UI. The guideline takes care of concrete layout, depending on
%external constraints such as enclosing pane size, screen resolution or even regional settings (for example, right-to-left writing system). As long
%as the logical structure remains unchanged no interference from end-users is required for laying out the UI in different settings. On the
%other hand these frameworks can be used as back-ends in our approach since they provide a similar set of layout primitives.
%
%Constraint programming has already been used for deciding the placement of GUI controls. One of the examples are constraint reactive programming
%language \textsc{Wallingford}~\cite{Wallingford2016} and the \textsc{Cassowary} system~\cite{Cassowary2001}. \textsc{Wallingford} allows to attach
%constraints of various strength to different values in the program. The system reacts to the time changes and updates these values without violation
%of the constraints. For example, one could calculate a width of a GUI control as the sine of current time. The \textsc{Cassowary} system and its
%descendants allow to calculate the sizes and positions of controls dynamically, for example at the moment of canvas resize.
%%The background theory is linear arithmetic.
%It supports many different constraints, for example, Z-ordering, arithmetic operators (for example, a control's width can be the half
%of another one's height), overlapping views, etc.  These systems are targeted for the tasks of dynamic adaptation the sizes of controls on resize.
%Also, they don't provide support of expressing general rules about correct control placing, the constraints are added for values of concrete structure.
%In our work we make a strict separation between GUI structure and rules of correct positioning of controls. We have doubts about expressing non-deterministic
%layouts in these systems, for example, if vertical or horizontal placement of controls depend on their sizes. On the other hand, the number of various
%constraint types is larger than in our approach. For example, they allow to express overlapping views, but based on our experience we initially ruled out
%this option, and our current implementation doesn't generate such layouts at all.
%
%Finally, in recent years methods and approaches from AI in ML/data-science sense start to percolate into the area. Some of the works address much more
%ambitious objectives, than ours.
%
%First of all, there is a direction of research on UI code generation from images~\cite{Cai2023}. Given a designer-drawn form, a code
%generator recognizes UI controls and their relative placements and generates implementation code for one of GUI frameworks. This approach
%is completely orthogonal and incompatible with what we suggest. Indeed, it requires an interaction with a designer when implementing every piece of
%an interface while in our case a designer is only involved when guidelines are developed; then our system produces guideline-compatible
%interfaces \emph{en masse} automatically. In~\cite{Robust} a slightly different task is addressed: given a picture of an interface synthesize its
%implementable layout in terms of Android GUI primitives which would be scalable across various devices while avoiding a typical layout errors.
%To achieve this goal, after recognizing UI controls and their locations a certain set of relational layout constraints is extracted. This
%set of constraints resembles our layout primitives but is aligned with Android's \texttt{ConstraintLayout} widget~\cite{ConstraintLayout} semantics.
%Given these constraints and a set of \emph{robustness properties} developed by the authors an implementation code is generated with
%the aid of a probabilistic model trained on a large set of existing Android interfaces. This implementation is more stable under screen size
%or resolution change, than that provided by image recognition only. Interestingly, one of the motivations for the work, as the authors
%specify explicitly, is that ``the same layout needs to be rendered potentially on more than 15 000 Android devices with $\approx$100 different density
%independent screen sizes. Requiring the user to provide and maintain input specifications for all of them is infeasible yet highly desirable.''
%That is exactly what our system is capable of doing within a few minutes and with 100\% accuracy, so we consider our approach
%much more general.
%
%Automatic design of consistent (uniform throughout an application) GUI is addressed in~\cite{LearningGUI}. The approach is based on the idea of completion:
%assuming there is already a set of consistent layouts a problem of adding yet another element is addressed; the addition should be consistent with the previous
%designs. While this problem is, indeed, related to that we address (indeed, consider an existing set of designs as an implicitly specified guideline),
%we can identify a number of potential weaknesses. First, only addition of a component is considered, but not removal; second, the addition/subtraction
%of components does not necessarily lead to a ``monotonic'' change of the layout (adding yet another text field may result is a drastically different placement);
%finally, the initial set of designs to be consistent with rarely comes out of a thin air; most likely it is a result of following some
%existing (and perhaps implicit) guidelines, which should be specified and followed explicitly.
%
%In~\cite{Grid} a much more ambitious problem of synthesizing a layout with no guidelines, based only on aesthetic, ergonomic, etc., metrics is considered.
%Genetic algorithm is employed for synthesis, and users' feedback is used as a way to measure the quality of the synthesis; the synthesis itself can
%sometimes take hours. While the approach presumably allows to synthesize aesthetically convincing layouts with no designer input, the problem of
%layout consistency for sufficiently different structures is left unaddressed.
%
%An interesting problem of layout exploration is considered in~\cite{Scout}. The objective is to help the \emph{designers} to develop convincing and
%diverse layouts. A set of constraints is introduced which designers can use in order to specify some requirements for the design. Interestingly, in our terms the
%set of constraints is a mixture of layout and structural ones: for example, both order and alignment constraints are present. Given
%a number of constraints the system generates a set of layouts consistent with this constraints; by updating the constraints a designer can
%continue the exploration. As a constraint solver modifier branch-and-bound algorithm is used; as the number of feasible solutions
%turned out to be enormous a set of heuristic metrics was developed to rule aesthetically unfeasible designs out. While this work
%shares some similarities with ours, being targeted on designers it can be considered as a mean to \emph{develop guidelines}, not to synthesize
%guideline-consistent designs.
