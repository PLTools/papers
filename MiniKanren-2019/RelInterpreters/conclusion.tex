\section{Conclusion and future work}

We have presented a way to construct a solver for a search problem from its solution verifier by first doing a relational conversion and then specializing the relation according to the desired execution direction by means of conjunctive partial deduction.

There are a few directions for future work. 

Even if we generate a relation optimized for the particular direction, executing it with \textsc{miniKanren} still carries some overhead of interpretation. We believe that the best performance can be achieved by generating a functional program from the relation optimized for the particular direction. 
This way we can avoid interpretation overhead but still get the benefits of the approach.  
The second direction is to explore other specialization techniques besides conjunctive partial deduction which are better suited for \textsc{miniKanren} programs.
