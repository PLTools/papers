We present an implementation of the relational programming language \miniKanren{} as a set
of combinators and syntax extensions for OCaml. The key feature of our approach is
\emph{polymorphic unification}, which can be used to unify data structures of arbitrary types.
In addition we provide a useful generic programming pattern to systematically develop relational
specifications in a typed manner, and address the problem of integration of relational subsystems into
functional applications.
