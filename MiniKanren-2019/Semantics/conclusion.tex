\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

In this paper we presented a formal semantics for core \textsc{miniKanren} and proved some its basic properties,
which are believed to hold in existing implementations. We consider our work as an initial setup for a future development
of \textsc{miniKanren} semantics. The language we considered here lacks many important features, which are already introduced
and employed in many implementations. Integrating these extensions~--- in the first hand, disequality constraints,~--- into
the semantics looks a natural direction for future work. We also are going to address the problems of proving some
properties of relational programs (equivalence, refutational completeness, etc.).
