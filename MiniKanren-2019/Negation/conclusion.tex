\section{Conclusion}

\label{sec:conclusion}

We have presented an implementation of constructive negation
for relational programming language \textsc{OCanren}, a dialect of \textsc{MiniKanren}.
Unlike the negation as failure,
constructive negation is consistent with 
the pure logical nature of \textsc{MiniKanren}.
As we have demonstrated the negative reasoning 
increases the expressive power of relational language
by allowing to compose more relations in a natural and intuitive form.
