\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

In this paper, we presented a certified formal semantics for core \textsc{miniKanren} and proved some of its basic properties
(including interleaving search completeness, disjunction fairness and commutativity), which are believed to hold in existing implementations.
We also derived a semantics for conventional SLD resolution with cut and extracted two certified reference interpreters.
We consider our work as the initial setup for the future development of \textsc{miniKanren} semantics.

The language we considered here lacks many important features, which are already introduced
and employed in many implementations. Integrating these extensions~--- in the first hand, disequality constraints,~--- into
the semantics looks a natural direction for future work. We are also going to address the problems of proving some
properties of relational programs (equivalence, refutational completeness, etc.).
